### Consultation

Austere provided pro bono medical support and a risk management plan to the Great Sandy 18 Camel Train fundraising expedition, May - June 2018. The epic 30-night, 1200km trek lead the two-person, six-camel team through Western Australia's most barren wilderness, covering part of the Canning Stock Route, raising money and awareness for Melanoma WA and the RFDS. Austere contributed to the safety of the expedition by; preparing a risk management plan for reference in the field, and consulting with medical centers and rotary-wing assets in the region to plan for medical evacuation.

### Training

Austere provided remote first-aid training and assisted with a suitable medical kit for the expedition. Challenges faced by the expedition team were numerous, including; extreme temperatures, isolation, limited water sources, wild dogs, aggressive wild camels and navigation hazards formed by the exploration tracks in the area.
