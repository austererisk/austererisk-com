Austere established safety and emergency management systems for the Maydena Bike Park in Tasmania. The Austere system improved safety across the park for both patrons and staff and included a risk management app, emergency management planning, and a network of trained wilderness responders.

The app provided a portal for managers, trail maintenance staff and volunteer responders to work together under one system to keep the park safe.
