# Introduction

- Pre-planning, mission, area etc. Don't assume the client will have all this done. Even if you're not getting paid for it.
- Support managers to deliver a safe workplace
- No backup or delayed backup
- "Not within my scope"
- Planning
  - Short term day 1 hour 1. Desktop
  - Medium term. Trained assistance
  - Longer term, fixed base, equipment, vehicles
- Look at existing skills in team
- Form adhoc emergency response team
  - Comms plan
- Approach manager for time for discussion or training. Rehearsal of incidents
- Familiarization of medical, rescue and communications kit
- Check in often with manager and team members
- Fix small problems before they become big
- Prevention, health, welfare,

  - Look for team members not coping. It is infinitely easier to treat dehydration, heat stroke, etc in the early stages. Assume people won't speak up due to...This means you need to be out and about as much as possible amongst the team, looking for problems and treating them early. Of course this is not as glamourous as calling in aeromedical evacuation for a P1 patient, but this article is for proactive remote medics, not rock stars.

Being a solo remote medic can be a daunting experience, even for someone experienced in this role. The isolation, both physically and environmentally, combined with the responsibility of preserving life in under-resourced environments, often only becomes real once you are on-location, when the adequacy (or inadequacy) of your preparedness is realised for the first-time. Medics will naturally be clinically-focused in their approach to these projects, with the majority of mental capacity dedicated to the injuries and illnesses they will likely face, however there is more to be considered.  
I have put together this guide over a period of time on various remote locations as a result of both doing things well, and making mistakes. It is aimed at those who take their roles seriously and not only want to provide the best possible medical service to their clients, but also add value to remote projects and ensure repeat work. It is not a clinical article (which would make it a textbook) but rather, as the title suggests, aimed topics not covered in medical training. This guide has, and will continue to be, my 'journal' of lessons learnt as a remote solo medic and I hope you find even a scrap of value to take into your own projects.  
I have divided this guide into three sections, representing the 'flow' of a normal project:

1. Preparation (the period leading up to the project)
2. Execution (in the field, undertaking the project)
3. Debrief (after the project has concluded)

# Preparation

There should be no surprises to learn here that preparation will make or break your success in a remote solo medic role. How you spend your preparation time leading up to the project will be determined by a number of factors:

1. The notice period you have
2. Your familiarity with the role, client, project, region, topography and environment
3. The complexity and risk level of the project

## Understand the Client

## Understand the Mission

The mission (objective, aim or purpose) of the remote activity should be clear and understood. You may receive a brief with a clear mission, or maybe just some dates and a rough outline of what is happening. At this point you should be formulating a list of information you require from the client and 'What is the Mission?' should be at top of the list. Clients may not include you in production talks leading up to the project, but this does not mean you shouldn't make it known that you are interested in understanding what the client is trying to achieve.  
Understanding the mission, although it may seem obvious, helps you to support the client better. An example of
