Austere provides medical support to [Kokoda Crossing](https://kokodacrossing.com/) for their iconic cultural and historical expeditions across the Owen Stanley Range in Papua New Guinea.

Austere expedition medics not only provide high-level care to sick and injured clients and staff, but take proactive steps to reduce the chances of an incident through education, pre-trek briefs and welfare monitoring before, during and after the expedition.

Planning for expedition medical support begins early with the lead-up time spent reviewing or consulting on the client's emergency management plans, studying maps, establishing routes (and alternate routes) for evacuation and prepping medical, rescue and communication equipment. Austere expedition medics are supported with operational and clinical support in the field via satellite communication, and will coordinate evacuation in the rare event that a patient cannot continue the expedition.

Please [get in touch](/contact) for a no-obligation chat about managing medical risk and evacuation on remote expeditions.
