Austere provided pro bono medical support and a risk management plan to the Great Sandy 18 Camel Train fundraising expedition, May - June 2018. The epic 30-night, 1200km trek lead the two-person, six-camel team through Western Australia's most barren wilderness, raising money and awareness for Melanoma WA and the RFDS.
