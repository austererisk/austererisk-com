# Plausible Deniability

Plausible deniability in security means that you can plausibly deny a request from an authority or threat actor and have a somewhat believable reason. For example, if a government official was attempting to force you to unlock an encrypted password manager with a master password, you could 'plausibly deny' that you remember the password. The government official may not believe you, but there's no denying that it's a plausible excuse - people do forget things. THe amount of resources a government official will throw at unlocking your encrypted data will be proportional to the potential information you have. For most of us, we are low-value travelers. On the other hand, if you use biometrics (fingerprint, retina, face) to unlock an encrypted vault, then it is impossible to deny that you have access to the vault. The official could simply hold the device to your eye, face or finger and unlock the vault. The amount of effort required to force you to unlock your encrypted data is low.

> Recommendation: Do not use biometric security on your field device. Instead, use a master password or passphrase that is committed to memory, and can be 'forgotten'.
