## Field Inspections
Austere Risk consultants can be involved in the planning process in areas such as; travel and route recons, accommodation inspections, film location inspections (scouting) and communication surveys . A custom map can be developed for your project to ensure all crew members are in sync.

## Production Risk Assessments
Austere develops production risk assessments for TV and Film projects. Risk assessments are not an off-the-shelf product; rather they are produced with an intimate knowledge of the production, locations, crew and hazards involved.

## Travel Risk Assessments
Risk assessments unrelated to production are often required where the crew are required to travel. Austere Risk will conduct thorough risk assessments to enable health, safety measures and contingency measures to be implemented.

## On-location Safety and Medical
Multi-skilled Austere Risk consultants will embed themselves into your crew to prevent things going wrong, and manage emergencies in the event they arise. With an emphasis on prevention, Austere Risk consultants will implement proactive measures such as:

- delivering safety briefs,
- wellness checks
- debriefing near-misses to prevent incidents

On the reactive side, Austere Risk consultants will manage emergencies, provide high-level field care, monitor injuries where the casualty is returned to work, or coordinate evacuation where required.

## High-risk Activity Support
Activities such as working at heights, filming dangerous wildlife, filming in conflict zones and extreme environments are all withing the capabilities of Austere Risk consultants.
